talkback.sh
===========

Have your terminal speak your commands.

## Usage

```bash
source talkback.sh
```

Then, use your terminal as usual,
and enjoy as all of the commands you issue
are spoken back to you.

## Caveats

So far, this has only been tested on OS X.
For support on other systems,
a replacement for the `say` command will be needed.

## Why?

Why not?

But more seriously,
I find that having spoken confirmation of commands helps keep my focus and attention.
